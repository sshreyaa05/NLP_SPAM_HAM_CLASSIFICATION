### Spam-Ham Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes with Text Preprocessing Techniques

### Overview:
The project aims to classify text messages into two categories: spam and ham (non-spam), using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The process involves preprocessing the text by tokenizing the data, removing stop words, and applying two different vectorization techniques: Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Following the preprocessing, the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is used to predict whether a message is spam or ham. The performance of both vectorization methods is compared, with the Bag of Words method yielding superior accuracy.

### Steps:

#### Text Preprocessing

 Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words (tokens), which serve as the basic units for further analysis.

 Stop Words Removal: Common words, such as “the,” “and,” and “in,” that do not contribute meaningful information, are removed from the text to reduce noise.

#### Vectorization

Bag of Words (BoW): This technique creates a matrix where each row represents a text message and each column corresponds to a unique word in the corpus. The value in each cell represents the frequency of the word in the message.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): This method transforms the text data into a numerical format by considering both the frequency of a word within a message and how rare the word is across all messages. This helps in emphasizing important words.

#### Model Training

The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained using the feature vectors generated by both BoW and TF-IDF methods. This model is particularly well-suited for text classification tasks where the features are word frequencies.

#### Model Evaluation

Both BoW and TF-IDF models are evaluated based on accuracy, and their performances are compared.

#### Results:
After training the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with both vectorization methods, it was observed that the Bag of Words method resulted in a higher accuracy rate for spam-ham classification compared to TF-IDF. This suggests that for this particular task, the Bag of Words approach was more effective in identifying spam and ham messages.
